# This is my honor thesis, my supervisor Danny Silver and me also submit a 6-page version to Canadian AI 2021, it is confirmed accepted and will be published soon. I will do a live presentaion one May 27th 12:45 EST(https://www.caiac.ca/en/conferences/canadianai-2021/program). I don't think anyone will need my code anyway, but feel free to take it if you need.
# CNN code is stored in ipynb, which should be modified using jupyter notebook and DBN code is just python, beware there are 2 model.py file. ✧(≖ ◡ ≖✿)
